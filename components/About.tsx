            Hi there! I&apos;m Kartikey Tiwari, also known as JustaKartik. I&apos;m an 18-year-old developer from Delhi, India, with a passion for both frontend and backend development. As a science stream student, I&apos;ve cultivated a deep interest in technology and how it can be harnessed to create impactful digital solutions.
            <br />
            My journey in tech began with a fascination for the inner workings of the internet. Over the years, I&apos;ve developed a diverse skill set, ranging from programming languages and design tools to various technologies like MySQL, MongoDB, Linux, networking, and Docker. I&apos;ve had the opportunity to work on exciting projects, including Mineboty, Qwaekactyl, Discord bots, and several npm packages. Additionally, I&apos;ve been involved in multiple private projects that have helped me refine my skills.
            <br />
            Previously, I was the founder of Team Ic, a venture that has since been discontinued. Currently, I&apos;m working with RudraCloud, a hosting company I founded, and I&apos;m excited to start a new journey with Coneiz. In my role, I handle both frontend and backend development, continually learning and growing in the field. Outside of coding, I enjoy exploring nature, sipping coffee at new spots, and attending tech meetups. I believe in the transformative power of technology and am committed to making a positive impact through my work.
            <br />
            Feel free to reach out if you&apos;d like to collaborate or learn more about what I do!
